# Azure Static Web App for Image Analysis and Generation

This project showcases an Azure Static Web App that provides image analysis and image generation functionalities. The app allows users to submit an image URL for analysis and uses the Azure Computer Vision API to analyze the image. Additionally, it leverages the DALL-E 4 Azure OpenAI API to generate images based on user-provided prompts.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Analyze any provided image URL to extract detailed information using the Azure Computer Vision API.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images based on textual prompts utilizing the cutting-edge capabilities of the DALL-E 4 model via the Azure OpenAI API.

## Image Generation Demo #1

Below is an example of an image generated using the DALL-E 4 Azure OpenAI API:

with Prompt: "Border Collie running in grass land"

## Image Generation Demo #2

Below is an example of an image generated using the DALL-E 4 Azure OpenAI API:

with Prompt: "A futuristic city in neon light"

## How It Works

1. **Submit an Image URL**: Users can enter any image URL into the application. This image is sent to the Azure Computer Vision API, which processes the image and returns analysis results.
2. **Enter a Prompt for Image Generation**: Users can also enter a text prompt for image generation. The prompt is processed by the DALL-E 4 Azure OpenAI API, which then generates an image based on the input.
